# CTT Checkout

This tool first started as a C# Console Application made with Visual Studio even before I entered university. I was selling my old shcool books online
and I was having trouble knowing how much I should charge for shipping costs when sending them with CTT (the national post service), so I just made a
quick app to tell me just that. It started super simple, with just one shipping method, and slowly grew to a more complex thing.

Fast forward to today, I was learning Python and wanted to do something to practice, so I had the idea of converting my C# app into Python. Well, I did
and it also turned more and more complex and now I'm invested in developing this little thing as I learn more about Python.
